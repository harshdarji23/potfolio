## The Book in 3 sentences üéØ

1. They say you're an average of 5 friends you spend the most time with. But in the digital era, you are an average of the content you consume. So, your job should be to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by.
2. There's nothing new under the sun. Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again. So, start copying what you love, add your element to it, and in the act of making things and doing work that you will figure out who you are.
3. The best way to get approval is to not need it. Don't make excuses for not working - make things with time, space, and materials you have, right now.

## Who should read it? üìö

This book is for everyone who feels like they do not have anything to offer to the world. This book is for the one who is too worried to put out content because of the fear of getting judged. This book will motivate you to share your work and will open paths that you have never imagined. And it's only a 2-hour read, so you have got no reason not to.

## How the book changed me? ü•∞

I have always had the urge to create content and share my ideas but then I feel why would people listen to me, what's my credibility and there are so many well-known people out there. Imposter syndrome kicks in hard. But after reading this book I have realized that if I start considering myself as a part of a creative lineage, I'll feel less alone. Well, this book has helped me to develop the courage to put out content (even if I consider it to be silly), And here I am writing on my blog again!

## My top 3 quotes üíØ

1. It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected
2. The best advice is not to write what you know, it‚Äôs to write what you like. The manifesto is this: Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use‚Äîdo the work you want to see done
3. You can‚Äôt connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards

## Summary + Notes üñã

## 1. Steal like an artist

**How to look at the world**

Don‚Äôt obsess over discovering your true calling. Instead, master rare and valuable skills. When you look at the world this way, you stop worrying about what‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù and what‚Äôs ‚Äúbad‚Äù‚Äîthere‚Äôs only stuff worth stealing, and stuff that‚Äôs not worth stealing

**Nothing is original**

What is originality? Undetected plagiarism

**Garbage in, garbage out**

**School yourself**

School is one thing. Education is another. The two don‚Äôt always overlap. Whether you‚Äôre in school or not, it‚Äôs always your job to get yourself an education. 

Google everything. I mean everything. Google your dreams, Google your problems. Don‚Äôt ask a question before you Google it. You‚Äôll either find the answer or you‚Äôll come up with a better question. Always be reading. Go to the library. There‚Äôs magic in being surrounded by books. Get lost in the stacks. Read bibliographies. It‚Äôs not the book you start with, it‚Äôs the book that book leads you to

## 2. Don't wait until you know you are to get started

**You're ready. Start making stuff**

**Fake it till you make it**

**Start copying**

Nobody is born with a style or a voice. We don‚Äôt come out of the womb knowing who we are. In the beginning, we learn by pretending to be our heroes. We learn by copying

Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing

**Imitation is not flattery**

Emulation is when imitation goes one step further, breaking through into your own thing

## 4. Use Your Hands

## 5. Side Projects and Hobbies are Important

The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life

**Practice productive procrastination**

Take time to mess around. Get lost. Wander. You never know where it‚Äôs going to lead you

**Do not throw any of yourself away**

A hobby is something that gives but doesn't take

## 6. The Secret: Do Good Work and Share it with People

It‚Äôs not that people are mean or cruel, they‚Äôre just busy

**Share your dots but do not connect them**

Learn to code. Figure out how to make a website. Figure out blogging. Figure out Twitter and social media and all that other stuf. Find people on the Internet who love the same things as you and connect with them. Share things with them

It‚Äôs your finger that has to hit the publish button. You have control over what you share and how much you reveal

## 7. Geography is No Longer our Master

**Build your own world**

All you need is a little space and a little time‚Äîa place to work, and some time to do it; a little self-imposed solitude and temporary captivity

**Leave Home**

Distance and difference are the secret tonics of creativity. When we get home, home is still the same. But something in our mind has been changed, and that changes everything

## 8. Be Nice (The World is a Small Town)

**Make friends, ignore enemies**

There's only one reason I am here: I am here to make friends

**Stand next to the talent**

Find the most talented person in the room, and if it‚Äôs not you, go stand next to him. Hang out with him. Try to be helpful

**Validation is for parking**

Once you put your work into the world, you have no control over the way people will react to it

The trick s to be too busy doing your work to care

## 9. Be Boring (It's the only way to get work done)

Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work

**Take care of yourself. Stay out of debt**

Son, it‚Äôs not the money you make, it‚Äôs the money you hold on to.‚Äù Make yourself a budget. Live within your means. Pack your lunch. Pinch pennies. Save as much as you can. Get the education you need for as cheap as you can get it. The art of holding on to money is all about saying no to consumer culture. Saying no to takeout, $4 lattes, and that shiny new computer when the old one still works fine

**Keep your day job**

Freedom from financial stress also mean freedom in your art

Establishing and keeping a routine can be even more important than having a lot of time. Inertia is the death of creativity. You have to stay in the groove. When you get out of the groove, you start to dread the work, because you know it‚Äôs going to suck for a while‚Äîit‚Äôs going to suck until you get back into the flow

**Marry well**

Who you marry is the most important decision you‚Äôll ever make. And ‚Äúmarry well‚Äù doesn‚Äôt just mean your life partner ‚Äîit also means who you do business with, who you befriend, who you choose to be around. Relationships are hard enough, but it takes a real champion of a person to be married to someone who‚Äôs obsessed with a creative pursuit. Lots of times you have to be a maid, a cook, a motivational speaker, a mother, and an editor‚Äîall at once.

## 10. Creativity is Subtraction

**Choose what to leave out**

In this age of information abundance and overload, those who get ahead will be the folks who figure out what to leave out, so they can concentrate on what‚Äôs really important to them. Nothing is more paralyzing than the idea of limitless possibilities
