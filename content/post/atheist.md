After reading this blog, it will not really matter whether you are an atheist or not.
So, my granny have been reading Mahabharata because so called month “Shravan” is approaching. Being a fan of mythology, I tossed couple of questions at her which she answered philosophically. I wasn’t satisfied so I corroborated innumerable amount of articles over the internet.

Well,there is an interesting interpretation about this Epic war Mahabharata.

Sanjay, the one who saw the great war from his third eye, the king slayer, at the end of the war decided to visit the place where this greatest war took place; Kurukshetra. He looked around and wondered if the war really happened, if the Pandavas and Krishna really stood here, if Krishna really evoked his verses on Bhagwat Gita on this ground soaked from blood of thousands.

‘You will never know the truth about that!’

said a soft ageing voice from behind.

Sanjay turned around to find an old man in white robes gazing at him out of the bright light of sun and column of dust. He was old but seemed like time has stopped for something important, Sanjay assumed.

‘I know you are here to find out about the Kurukshetra war, but you cannot know about that war till you know what the real war is about.’ the old man said enigmatically.

‘What do you mean?’ came reply from Sanjay.

**‘The Mahabharata is an Epic, a ballad, maybe a reality but definitely a philosophy.’**

Interestingly the only Ballad which Hinduism saw.

‘Can you tell me what the philosophy is then?’ Sanjay enquired.

Sure, exclaimed the voice.

‘The Pandavas are nothing but your five senses, sight, smell, taste, touch and sound and do you know what the Kauravas are?’

he asked narrowing his eyes.

‘The Kauravas are the hundred vices that attack your senses everyday but you can fight them and do you know how?’

Sanjay nodded again.


‘When Krishna rides your chariot !’The voice smiled and lured Sanjay to ask more, he could see the bliss inside.

“Krishna is your inner voice, your soul, your guiding light and if you let your life in his guiding hands you have nothing to worry.’

Sanjay was numb but came with another question.

‘Then why is Dronacharya and Bhishma fighting for the Kauravas, if they are vices?’

The old man nodded, sadder for the question.

‘It just means that as you grow up your perception of your elders change. The elders who you thought were perfect in your growing years are not at all that perfect. They have faults. And one day you will have to decide if they are for good or your bad. Then you may realise that you may have to fight them for the good. It is the hardest part of the growing up and that is why the Geeta is important.’

Sanjay, failed to realise the reality and philosophy of Mahabharata, slumped down not because he was tired but because he could understand and was struck by the enormity of it all.

‘What about Karna?’ he whispered.

‘Ah!’ said the Old voice. ‘You have saved the best for the last. Karna is the brother to your senses, he is Desire, he is a part of your intellect but stands with the vices. He feels wronged and makes excuses for being with the vices as your desire does all the time.’

Sanjay looked at the ground, consumed with a million thoughts, trying to put everything together and then when he looked up the Old man was gone. As he went, it became dark, seemed like the light has gone.

###### Third eye which has given all the insights forever gave him the last philosophy of life which will become the teaching for this world
