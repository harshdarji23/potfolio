When I started 2020, like many, I had set goals and resolutions for myself. 
But when I began goal setting for 2021, I realized that I failed to achieve most of my goals for 2020. 
So, I reached out to [Kavir](https://twitter.com/KavirKaycee) on Twitter because I highly resonated with his Tweets to seek help with goal setting and I received fabulous advice on doing a review of the year to better understand myself, my goals, and what has impacted me the most. 
I have used Kavir's [framework](https://twitter.com/KavirKaycee/status/1215342727136600064?s=20) and [Troy Shu's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/troyshu/) [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J_SMilIOZz032ntcMgKelbxe8irqZm6KSlAMG93YHvY/edit) to structure my thoughts and review my 2020.
