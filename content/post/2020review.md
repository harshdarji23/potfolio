When I started 2020, like many, I had set goals and resolutions for myself. 
But when I began goal setting for 2021, I realized that I failed to achieve most of my goals for 2020. 
So, I reached out to [Kavir](https://twitter.com/KavirKaycee) on Twitter because I highly resonated with his Tweets to seek help with goal setting and I received fabulous advice on doing a review of the year to better understand myself, my goals, and what has impacted me the most. 
I have used Kavir's [framework](https://twitter.com/KavirKaycee/status/1215342727136600064?s=20) and [Troy Shu's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/troyshu/) [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J_SMilIOZz032ntcMgKelbxe8irqZm6KSlAMG93YHvY/edit) to structure my thoughts and review my 2020.

### Emotional Well-being
{{< twitter 1005107581289824256 >}}

Like most years I started 2020 with a very positive mindset and pumped up to achieve my wildest dreams. But when I graduated in the middle of a pandemic, facing an extremely competitive job market my mental health started deteriorating. This was the time I was living by myself and instead of finding an escape from my thoughts, I decided to dive deeper and find out the reason behind my feelings. After introspection, I realized that I have been raised in a competitive environment where I had to be the best, be it studies, sports, or any activity I participated in. Basically, I was trying to be as rich as Jeff Bezos, as good-looking as Tom Cruise, and as charming as Dwayne Johnson which was very overwhelming and stressful. I cannot compete with their strongest suits, I would rather compete with myself and this realization has changed the game for me. I am glad to have found a job in the middle of a pandemic and work with a very supportive team (my manager is the BEST) which has affected my emotional well-being positively. Since the last two months, I have formed nice habits of reading regularly, meditating frequently, journaling, tracking my sleep time, and counting my calories. 

Reading [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299) by James Clear and following really smart people on Twitter has helped me to work on my habits and increase my productivity.

### Physical Well-being

I have always enjoyed staying outdoors either playing cricket or basketball or working out at the gym but due to the lockdown, I was not able to do either of those things. Around July I was in the worst shape of my life at 78 kgs with body fat of 14%. That's when I started running 3 miles a day with a friend but I did not enjoy running and stopped after 2 weeks. Luckily the gyms opened and I was excited to get back at it but they shut it down soon and to reduce my weight I began tracking my calories and significantly reduced the intake to 1500 Kcal. I really enjoy playing sports and working out so I believe it's not going to be a lot of a hassle to get back to what I like doing. However, I am targeting a single digit body fat percentage before my birthday which is in 5 months from now and become flexible. This is going to be challenging yet fun.

# Career üë®üèº‚Äçüíª
I had taken multiple classes related to machine learning, statistics, and analytics and I found data science very interesting but the job market was very varied. You had to pick jobs related to machine learning, data engineering/business intelligence, or product data science. You cannot do everything and to prepare for each area was exhaustive. I was lucky to stumble upon [Emma's blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-got-4-data-science-offers-and-doubled-my-income-2-months-after-being-laid-off-b3b6d2de6938) and get clarity on the skills required for breaking into Data Science. I highly recommend subscribing to her [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DataInterviewPro) as she shares details about interviews, networking, and developing skills for data science. I had an interview with Zoro in April but they decided to hire internally, I kept in touch with them and they reached out to me with an opportunity in September to work as a Merchandising Analyst. This year I started my first full-time role remotely and I feel all my worries have settled down. My role is in the business team and I operate somewhere in the intersection of product, data, and automation to build a scalable solution to collect and enrich product information.

I have also worked on a couple of side projects:

1. [Building a Disaster response Web-Application](https://www.harshdarji.com/2020/05/building-a-disaster-response-web-application/)
2. [Will Your Education Pay You Well?](https://www.harshdarji.com/2020/01/will-your-education-pay-you-well/)
3. [How to Identify Potential Customers Among the Crowd?](https://www.harshdarji.com/2020/04/how-to-identify-potential-customers-among-the-crowd/)

# Relationship üë©üèº‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßëüèº

Although I did not see my family this year, I have gotten closer to them. Regular video calls with my sister and my mom kept me sane. I know my family is not perfect, but this year I have learned to appreciate them as they are. I am excited to see them for my graduation in 2021 and visit NYC and Florida with them.

When it comes to friends, I noticed that I have a lot of friends but not a lot of them are close friends. Also, I realized that I enjoy hanging out with a small group and get to know them on a personal level. I had some toxic friends who used to get jealous and brought a lot of negative vibes and thanks to covid I have gotten rid of them. This year I am going to keep my ego aside, make the first move and reach out to people I genuinely care about, and dive deeper instead of going broader!

It's been quite long since I actually dated and I was too occupied with myself to even consider dating. I have spoken to several potential mates but rejected the idea of dating because I get bored of them or judge them based on their appearances. As I want a lot from myself, I expect a lot from my potential partner and that's one of the reasons I have not dated anyone. I need to go beyond looks and look for an emotional connection and availability. Also, another excuse I gave myself was that I am in grad school and I am looking for a job so I do not have time. But now that I have a job and I am emotionally stable, I will go out on more dates, explore various relationships and go beyond beauty!

No one can compete with you on being you. This year I am going to focus on learning and building things I am genuinely passionate about - sports, product data science, game theory, and startups that have disrupted the traditional models (Airbnb, Uber, Doordash)

[Ultralearning](https://www.notion.so/Ultralearning-2507ce63b4564f0482a544749e31b1f1)¬†by Scott Young has changed my outlook towards learning and I am confident I can delve into unchartered territories whether or not I have the right background.

# FUN ü§üüèº

As I am writing this, I have noticed that fun and learning are interconnected for me which is not necessarily bad but the problem is I don't do things for the sake of it or just for the pleasure but for competing and winning. This year I want to do things just for pure fun and without seeking any benefits. I have never been a reader in my life, but surprisingly I found my type of books and was able to read around¬†[10 books](https://www.notion.so/Book-Reading-Tracker-89130c3508a8494bbfabc73547d18445)¬†this year. I layed a lot of PubG and chess in the first half of 2020 then I felt guilty for wasting a lot of time. I did watch a fair number of movies and TV shows,¬†[The Last Dance](https://www.netflix.com/title/80203144)¬†and¬†[The Queen's Gambit](https://www.netflix.com/title/80234304)¬†being my favorite. I enjoyed watching NBA and my favorite NBA player (LeBron James) winning The Championship made 2020 joyful. Lastly, I treated myself to a trip to Phoenix - Vegas - the Grand Canyon - Sedona and it's one of the nicest places I have ever been to.

I colored my hair blonde and now I am moving to Chicago, taking the New Year, New Me very seriously üòõ
