      <description>I work at Zoro on the newly formed Enrichment team as a Merchandising Automation Analyst. I operate somewhere in the intersection of product, data, and automation to build a scalable solution to collect and enrich product information.
I love learning and building things. More specifically, I like programming, fitness, investing, reading, and meditating. I frequently write for Towards Data Science and Towards AI on Medium publication.
If you want to get in touch, I&amp;rsquo;m most responsive over email and I tend to be pretty active on LinkedIn dot com as well.</description>
